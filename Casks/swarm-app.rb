  caveats <<~EOS
    Swarm is not notarized by Apple, so macOS blocks its first launch. Allow it once:
      1. Open Swarm from Applications. When macOS says it cannot verify the app, click Done.
      2. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security and scroll to Security.
      3. Next to "Swarm was blocked", click Open Anyway and confirm with your password.
    If Open Anyway does not show, run:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Swarm.app
